The "newest" nightly buildss of the IDE 2.0 use the AppImage (fltpak) file format.  You should be able to double click on the ".AppImage" from the File Manager and get the IDE up and running. Assuming the "undefined" directory is in the same directory as the "AppImage" file.

For quite some time now I have been a part of the Arduino team but only working on the Linux Launcher.

I submitted some scripts quite some time ago but they are out of date.  I am includeing the updated scripts which are much more useful.  The idea is to create proper ".desktop" files so that you can launch the IDE from the Gnome dock.  There are actually 2 versions of the ".desktop" file supporting a local user only mode or a systemwide mode.  This way you could have a "stable" release available to all users on the Linux system and a separate "nightly" version for a development user.

I am not a "git" expert and do not remember how to update ( or is it merge? ) the files originally sent to Arduino.  So I am posting them here.

Just add the ".png", the ".sh" and the ".template" files to the directory where the Arduino ".AppImage" file is located.  If there is no sub directory named "undefined" you will need to download and install the "undefined" directory provided here. It is required by the IDE for logging purposes.  The run the ".sh" script.  You will need to open a terminal session ( right-click in the directory from the File Manager and select "Open in Terminal" ) the execute ./Linux_Install.sh.  ( You may need to make it executable by running chmod +x Linux_Install.sh ) and follow instructions.
