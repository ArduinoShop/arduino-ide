The "newest" nightly buildss of the IDE 2.0 use the AppImage (fltpak) file format.  You should be able to double click on the ".AppImage" from the File Manager and get the IDE up and running.

For quite some time now I have been a part of the Arduino team but only working on the Linux Launcher.

I submitted some scripts quite some time ago but they are out of date.  I am includeing the updated scripts which are much more useful.  The idea is to create proper ".desktop" files so that you can launch the IDE from the Gnome dock.  There are actually 2 versions of the ".desktop" file supporting a local user only mode or a systemwide mode.  This way you could have a "stable" release available to all users on the Linux system and a separate "nightly" version for a development user.

I am not a "git" expert and do not remember how to update ( or is it merge? ) the files originally sent to Arduino.  So I am posting them here.
